 	<h2 class="Master">Master's</h2>
 	<p> I have Master degree in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics from the University of São Paulo(USP). My master project consisted of applying data mining to complex neural networks of patients with mental illnesses in an attempt at non-invasive diagnosis. The scope of the work includes the use of machine learning algorithms (such as neural networks, Bayesian classiﬁers, among others) and statistical analysis of patients with neurological diseases (such as schizophrenia, autism, etc.), in order to try non-invasive diagnosis.</p>
